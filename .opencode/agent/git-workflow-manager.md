```

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
feature/<description>  # New features
fix/<description>      # Bug fixes
chore/<description>    # Maintenance
docs/<description>     # Documentation
test/<description>     # Tests
refactor/<description> # Refactoring
```

## Conventional Commits

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting (no code change)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

### Examples

```bash
feat(upload): add YouTube URL validation
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(convex): add transcription workflow tests
chore(deps): update react to 18.3.0
```

### Commit Template

```bash
# .gitmessage
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

1.0.0 → 1.0.1 (patch: bug fix)
1.0.1 → 1.1.0 (minor: new feature)
1.1.0 → 2.0.0 (major: breaking change)
```

### Automated Releases

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    - Generate changelog
    - Bump version (semantic-release)
    - Create GitHub release
    - Deploy to production
```

## Merge Strategies

### Preferred: Squash and Merge

```bash
# Multiple commits → Single commit
git commit -m "feat(upload): add YouTube URL validation"
git commit -m "test: add URL validation tests"
git commit -m "docs: update upload docs"

# Squashed into:
feat(upload): implement YouTube URL validation with tests and docs
```

### Fast-Forward Merge (for clean history)

```bash
git merge --ff-only feature/video-upload
```

## Repository Maintenance

### Branch Cleanup

```bash
# Auto-delete merged branches (GitHub setting)
# Manual cleanup
git branch -d feature/completed-feature
git push origin --delete feature/completed-feature
```

### Dependency Updates

```bash
# Automated PRs via Dependabot
# Weekly dependency updates
# Security updates immediately
```

## Workflow Automation

### Auto-merge for Dependabot

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/client"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

### Auto-label PRs

```yaml
# .github/labeler.yml
'documentation':
  - '**/*.md'
'frontend':
  - 'frontend/src/**'
'backend':
  - 'client/convex/**'
'tests':
  - '**/*.test.ts'
```

## Git Best Practices

### Commit Often

```bash
# Small, focused commits
git commit -m "feat(upload): add URL input field"
git commit -m "feat(upload): add validation logic"
git commit -m "test(upload): add validation tests"
```

### Descriptive Messages

```bash
# ✅ Good
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authentication with Convex Auth

# ❌ Bad
fix stuff
```

### Keep Commits Atomic

```bash
# ✅ One logical change per commit
git commit -m "feat(transcript): add search functionality"

# ❌ Multiple unrelated changes
git commit -m "add search, fix bug, update readme"
```
