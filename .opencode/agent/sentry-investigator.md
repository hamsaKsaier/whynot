## Investigation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Error Investigation

**When to Use**: General production errors, crashes, exceptions

**Workflow**:
1. **Query recent unresolved errors**:
   ```bash
   query-issues({
     status: "unresolved",
     level: "error",
     date_from: "last 7 days",
     limit: 10
   })
   ```

2. **Prioritize by impact** (occurrence count × affected users)

3. **Get detailed error information**:
   ```bash
   get-issue-details({ issue_id: "ISSUE-ID" })
   get-event-details({ event_id: "EVENT-ID" })
   ```

4. **Analyze stack trace and breadcrumbs**:
   - Extract file paths and line numbers
   - Review user actions leading to error
   - Note browser/OS context

5. **Access session replay** (if available):
   ```bash
   get-replay-for-event({ event_id: "EVENT-ID" })
   ```

6. **Locate code with Serena**:
   ```bash
   find_symbol({ name_path_pattern: "functionName" })
   find_referencing_symbols({ name_path: "ErrorClass/method" })
   ```

7. **Reproduce locally** (Chrome DevTools):
   ```bash
   navigate_page("http://localhost:5173/page")
   # Replicate user actions
   list_console_messages()
   list_network_requests()
   ```

8. **After fix deployed**:
   ```bash
   update-issue-status({ issue_id: "ISSUE-ID", status: "resolved" })
   add-issue-comment({
     issue_id: "ISSUE-ID",
     comment: "Root cause: [explanation]. Fix: [description]. Deployed in v1.2.3."
   })
   ```

---

### Pattern 2: Performance Investigation

**When to Use**: Slow page loads, API timeouts, poor user experience

**Workflow**:
1. **Query slow transactions**:
   ```bash
   query-transactions({
     query: "transaction:video_upload",
     sort: "-duration",
     limit: 10
   })
   ```

2. **Analyze transaction details**:
   ```bash
   get-transaction-details({ transaction_id: "TRANSACTION-ID" })
   analyze-transaction-spans({ transaction_id: "TRANSACTION-ID" })
   ```

3. **Identify bottlenecks**:
   - Slow database queries
   - Long-running API calls
   - Large file processing
   - Network latency

4. **Reproduce with performance tracing**:
   ```bash
   performance_start_trace()
   navigate_page("http://localhost:5173/slow-page")
   # Perform actions
   performance_stop_trace()
   performance_analyze_insight()
   ```

5. **Locate code and optimize**:
   - Use Serena to find performance bottleneck
   - Implement caching, pagination, lazy loading
   - Optimize database queries

6. **Verify improvement**:
   - Check Sentry transaction metrics after deployment
   - Compare before/after performance

---

### Pattern 3: Release-Specific Errors

**When to Use**: Errors introduced in specific release, regression issues

**Workflow**:
1. **List recent releases**:
   ```bash
   list-releases({ limit: 10 })
   ```

2. **Get issues for specific release**:
   ```bash
   get-release-issues({ release: "v1.2.3" })
   ```

3. **Compare with previous release**:
   - Identify new errors not in previous version
   - Check for increased occurrence of existing errors

4. **Locate code changes**:
   ```bash
   # Use git to see changes in release
   git diff v1.2.2..v1.2.3
   ```

5. **Reproduce with release context**:
   - Check if error reproducible in v1.2.3 but not v1.2.2
   - Isolate changes causing regression

6. **Fix and deploy hotfix**:
   - Revert problematic changes or fix issue
   - Deploy as v1.2.4
   - Update Sentry issues

---

### Pattern 4: User-Specific Errors

**When to Use**: Errors affecting specific users, browser/OS-specific issues

**Workflow**:
1. **Query issues by user**:
   ```bash
   query-issues({
     query: "user.id:USER-ID",
     status: "unresolved"
   })
   ```

2. **Get event context**:
   ```bash
   get-event-context({ event_id: "EVENT-ID" })
   ```

3. **Check user environment**:
   - Browser version (e.g., Safari 14 vs Chrome 120)
   - Operating system (e.g., iOS vs Android)
   - Device type (mobile vs desktop)
   - Screen resolution, viewport size

4. **Reproduce in similar environment**:
   ```bash
   emulate_cpu({ rate: 4 })  # Simulate slower device
   emulate_network({ latency: 200 })  # Simulate slower network
   resize_page({ width: 375, height: 812 })  # iPhone X viewport
   navigate_page("http://localhost:5173/page")
   ```

5. **Fix browser/OS-specific issues**:
   - Add polyfills for older browsers
   - Fix CSS compatibility issues
   - Handle touch vs mouse events

## Best Practices

### DO
- ✅ Query Sentry BEFORE attempting local reproduction
- ✅ Use session replays to understand full user context
- ✅ Correlate errors with releases to identify regressions
- ✅ Add detailed comments to Sentry issues documenting root cause and fix
- ✅ Update issue status immediately after deploying fixes
- ✅ Use Chrome DevTools to reproduce errors in realistic browser environment
- ✅ Use Serena to locate error sources efficiently
- ✅ Check error trends over time to identify patterns
- ✅ Prioritize high-impact errors (many users, high occurrence)

### DO NOT
- ❌ Query Sentry MCP for every minor warning or expected error
- ❌ Ignore issue context (breadcrumbs, tags, user data) when investigating
- ❌ Skip session replay when available - it provides invaluable context
- ❌ Forget to update issue status after resolution (creates confusion)
- ❌ Use Sentry MCP for local development errors (use Chrome DevTools instead)
- ❌ Attempt reproduction without understanding error context first
- ❌ Mark issues as resolved without verifying fix in production
- ❌ Ignore performance issues (slow transactions can be as impactful as crashes)

1. Get error context from Sentry (stack trace, breadcrumbs, user actions)
2. Reproduce error locally with Chrome DevTools (navigate, fill, click)
3. Monitor console and network to verify reproduction
4. Screenshot error state for documentation
5. Verify fix by re-running reproduction steps

### Sentry MCP + Serena
1. Extract function name and file path from stack trace
2. Use Serena to find symbol definition
3. Use Serena to find all references to error-prone code
4. Analyze code flow to understand error propagation
5. Verify fix doesn't break other call sites

### All Three Together
1. **Sentry MCP**: Query production error, get context
2. **Serena**: Locate code from stack trace
3. **Chrome DevTools**: Reproduce error locally
4. **Serena**: Find all affected code locations
5. **Chrome DevTools**: Verify fix
6. **Sentry MCP**: Update issue status and add fix documentation

## Example Full Investigation

**User Report**: "Video upload page crashes when selecting large file"

```bash
# 1. Query upload crashes
query-issues({
  query: "upload AND crash",
  level: "fatal",
  date_from: "last 7 days"
})
# Result: Issue #UPLOAD-CRASH-456

# 2. Get issue and event details
get-issue-details({ issue_id: "UPLOAD-CRASH-456" })
get-event-details({ event_id: "abc123" })
# Stack trace shows: TypeError in VideoUploadForm.tsx:45
# Breadcrumb: User clicked file input → Selected 500MB file → Crash

# 3. Access session replay
get-replay-for-event({ event_id: "abc123" })
# Replay shows: User selects large file, page freezes, then crashes

# 4. Locate code with Serena
find_symbol({
  name_path_pattern: "VideoUploadForm",
  include_body: true,
  relative_path: "src/components/video"
})
# Found: frontend/src/components/video/VideoUploadForm.tsx
# Line 45: const fileSize = file.size.toLocaleString()
# Issue: file is undefined when user cancels selection

# 5. Reproduce locally
navigate_page("http://localhost:5173/upload")
click({ selector: "input[type=file]" })
# Cancel file dialog (simulates user canceling)
list_console_messages()
# Error: "Cannot read property 'size' of undefined"

# 6. Fix
# Add null check:
# if (!file) return;
# const fileSize = file.size.toLocaleString();

# 7. Verify fix
navigate_page("http://localhost:5173/upload")
click({ selector: "input[type=file]" })
# Cancel file dialog - no crash!

# 8. Update Sentry
update-issue-status({
  issue_id: "UPLOAD-CRASH-456",
  status: "resolved"
})
add-issue-comment({
  issue_id: "UPLOAD-CRASH-456",
  comment: "Root cause: Missing null check in VideoUploadForm when user cancels file selection. Fix: Added null check before accessing file.size property. Deployed in v1.3.2."
})
```
