# Conversion Patterns Reference

## PASTOR Framework Detailed Breakdown

The PASTOR framework is a direct-response copywriting structure that guides a prospect from problem awareness to purchase action. Each letter represents a stage of the persuasion process.

### P - Problem

**Goal**: Make the visitor feel understood. Name their pain before offering any solution.

**Psychology**: People pay attention when they see their own situation described accurately. If you can articulate their problem better than they can, they assume you have the solution.

**Implementation on whynot Landing Page**:

```
Component: HeroSection
Headline pattern: "[Specific pain point] + [Quantified impact]"

Examples:
  "Your cloud bill doubled. Your features didn't."
  "Paying $20/seat just to deploy a container?"
  "One surprise Vercel bill away from blowing your budget"
```

**Headline Rules**:
- Maximum 12 words in headline
- Include a number when possible (cost, time, percentage)
- Address the visitor directly ("your", "you")
- Name the specific platform if targeting switchers
- Subheadline explains what whynot does (max 25 words)

```
Component: PainPointsSection
Pattern: 3-4 pain points, each with icon + headline + description

Structure per pain point:
  Icon:        Visual metaphor for the pain
  Headline:    4-6 word problem statement
  Description: 1-2 sentences quantifying the impact
  Proof:       Optional stat or competitor data point
```

### A - Amplify

**Goal**: Make the cost of inaction vivid. The visitor must feel that NOT switching is more painful than switching.

**Psychology**: Loss aversion is 2x stronger than gain motivation. Show what they lose by staying, not what they gain by switching.

**Implementation**:

```
Component: ComparisonSection
Pattern: Side-by-side cost comparison table

Structure:
  Row 1: Monthly base cost          (whynot vs Competitor)
  Row 2: Per-seat cost              ($0 vs $20/seat)
  Row 3: Bandwidth cost             ($0 vs $0.15/GB)
  Row 4: Annual total for team of 5 (Calculated, highlighted)
  Row 5: Annual savings             (Bold, colored, large font)
```

```
Component: SavingsCalculator
Pattern: Interactive calculator with sliders

Inputs:
  - Current platform (dropdown)
  - Team size (slider: 1-50)
  - Monthly bandwidth (slider: 10GB-1TB)
  - Number of services (slider: 1-20)

Outputs:
  - Current annual cost (red)
  - whynot annual cost (green)
  - Annual savings (large, bold, animated counter)
  - Monthly savings breakdown
```

**Amplification Rules**:
- Always show annual costs (bigger numbers = more impactful)
- Use red/negative colors for competitor costs
- Use green/positive colors for savings amounts
- Animate the savings number counting up (draws attention)
- Show savings in both absolute dollars and percentage

### S - Story / Solution

**Goal**: Transition from problem to possibility. Show a clear path from current pain to desired outcome.

**Psychology**: People buy solutions to their problems, not features. Lead with the outcome, then explain how.

**Implementation**:

```
Component: HowItWorksSection
Pattern: 3-step process

Step 1: "Connect"        - Push code or import Docker Compose
Step 2: "Configure"      - Set environment, domains, resources
Step 3: "Deploy"         - One click, automatic SSL, live in minutes

Each step: Icon + Number + Title + 1-sentence description
```

```
Component: FeaturesSection
Pattern: Feature grid, 6-9 features

Each feature:
  Icon:        Relevant Lucide icon
  Title:       Outcome-focused (not feature-focused)
  Description: 1-2 sentences on the benefit
  Badge:       Optional "New" or "AI-Powered" tag

Feature ordering (by visitor priority):
  1. Docker Compose support (migration ease)
  2. Flat pricing (cost concern)
  3. AI builders (differentiation)
  4. Auto-SSL (convenience)
  5. Monitoring (reliability)
  6. Team collaboration (scalability)
```

### T - Transformation

**Goal**: Show the before/after state. Make success tangible through real examples.

**Psychology**: Testimonials and case studies provide vicarious experience. The visitor mentally places themselves in the success story.

**Implementation**:

```
Component: TestimonialsSection
Pattern: 3 testimonials addressing top 3 objections

Testimonial 1 (Cost objection):
  Quote:   "We saved $1,400/month switching from Vercel..."
  Person:  Name, Title, Company, Photo
  Context: Team size, use case

Testimonial 2 (Reliability objection):
  Quote:   "99.99% uptime for 6 months straight..."
  Person:  Name, Title, Company, Photo
  Context: Traffic volume, criticality

Testimonial 3 (Migration objection):
  Quote:   "Migrated 12 services in an afternoon..."
  Person:  Name, Title, Company, Photo
  Context: Previous platform, migration scope
```

**Testimonial Rules**:
- Real names and companies (never anonymous)
- Photos increase credibility by 35%
- Quote must address a specific objection
- Include quantified result when possible
- Maximum 3 sentences per quote

```
Component: StatsSection
Pattern: 3-4 key metrics in large, bold numbers

Metrics:
  "99.99%"  - Uptime SLA
  "< 200ms" - Average response time
  "2,000+"  - Active developers
  "10M+"    - Deployments processed
```

### O - Offer

**Goal**: Present what they get. Make the value clearly exceed the price.

**Psychology**: The price should feel inevitable after all the value demonstrated. Anchoring against competitors makes the number feel small.

**Implementation**:

```
Component: PricingSection
Pattern: 3-tier pricing table

Layout:
  [FREE]         [PRO - Highlighted]    [ENTERPRISE]
  $0/mo          $29/mo                 Custom

  Feature list   Feature list           Feature list
  (5-7 items)    (8-10 items)           (All + extras)

  [Start Free]   [Start Free Trial]     [Contact Sales]
```

```
Component: SecuritySection
Pattern: Trust badges + brief descriptions

Elements:
  - Data encryption (at rest + in transit)
  - SOC2 compliance status
  - GDPR compliance
  - Data sovereignty options
  - Regular security audits
```

### R - Response

**Goal**: Tell the visitor exactly what to do. Remove every possible friction point.

**Psychology**: Decision fatigue causes inaction. One clear CTA with explicit next step and risk reversal overcomes the final hurdle.

**Implementation**:

```
Component: CTASection
Pattern: Final call-to-action block

Structure:
  Headline:      "Deploy your first app in 5 minutes"
  Subheadline:   "No credit card required. Free forever plan available."
  Primary CTA:   "Start Deploying Free" (large button)
  Secondary CTA: "Talk to an expert" (text link)
  Trust:         "Join 2,000+ developers" (social proof reminder)
```

```
Component: MigrationSection
Pattern: Migration ease reassurance

Structure:
  Headline:      "Switch from [Competitor] in minutes"
  Steps:         3-step migration process
  CTA:           "Start Your Migration"
  Guarantee:     "We'll help you migrate for free"
```

## Trust Escalation Ladder

Trust signals must be ordered by commitment level. Early signals require no investment from the brand. Later signals require verifiable claims.

### Level 1: Borrowed Trust (Logo Wall)

**Position**: Immediately after hero section (first scroll)
**Component**: LogoWallSection

**Rules**:
- Show 6-8 recognizable company logos
- Logos should span different industries (shows broad appeal)
- All logos must be authorized for use
- Grayscale logos on light backgrounds (professional appearance)
- Color logos on dark backgrounds
- Animate with subtle horizontal scroll on mobile

**Psychology**: "If these companies trust whynot, maybe I should too." Borrows credibility from established brands.

### Level 2: Social Proof Numbers (Social Proof Bar)

**Position**: Below logo wall or integrated into hero
**Component**: SocialProofBar

**Rules**:
- Use specific numbers: "2,147 developers" not "2,000+"
- 3-4 metrics maximum
- Update numbers monthly (stale numbers erode trust)
- Animate numbers counting up on first viewport entry

**Examples**:
```
2,147 Developers  |  10.3M Deployments  |  99.99% Uptime  |  4.8/5 Rating
```

**Psychology**: Large numbers signal popularity. Specific numbers signal honesty.

### Level 3: Peer Testimonials

**Position**: After features/solution presentation (mid-page)
**Component**: TestimonialsSection

**Rules**:
- Named individuals with photo, title, company
- Each testimonial addresses one of the top 3 visitor objections
- Include quantified results ("saved $X", "deployed Y% faster")
- 3 testimonials is the optimal number (enough variety, not overwhelming)
- Rotate different testimonials for different audience segments via A/B test

**Psychology**: Named testimonials are 8x more credible than anonymous reviews. Photos add another 35% credibility.

### Level 4: Security and Compliance

**Position**: Near pricing section (purchase-decision proximity)
**Component**: SecuritySection

**Rules**:
- Show certification badges (SOC2, GDPR)
- Explain data handling briefly
- Link to detailed security page
- Mention data sovereignty options

**Psychology**: Security concerns peak at purchase moment. Addressing them here reduces last-minute abandonment.

### Level 5: Performance Metrics

**Position**: Before final CTA
**Component**: StatsSection

**Rules**:
- Show independently verifiable metrics
- Include time period ("99.99% uptime over last 12 months")
- Link to status page for live verification
- Update automatically from monitoring systems when possible

**Psychology**: Hard numbers just before the CTA reinforce the decision. Verifiability = maximum credibility.

## Micro-Commitment Pattern

### Theory

A micro-commitment is a small action that moves the visitor closer to conversion without triggering objection. Each step is easy enough that saying "no" feels harder than saying "yes."

### The whynot Commitment Ladder

```
Commitment 0: Land on page
  Cost to visitor:  0 (attention only)
  Value delivered:  Problem articulation ("you're overpaying")
  Next trigger:     Scroll to calculator

Commitment 1: Use savings calculator
  Cost to visitor:  ~30 seconds of interaction
  Value delivered:  Personalized savings estimate
  Next trigger:     "Get full savings report" email capture

Commitment 2: Provide email
  Cost to visitor:  Email address
  Value delivered:  Detailed savings report PDF + deployment tips
  Next trigger:     "Try it free" CTA in email sequence

Commitment 3: Create free account
  Cost to visitor:  2 minutes (email + password)
  Value delivered:  Access to platform, free tier features
  Next trigger:     Onboarding guide to first deployment

Commitment 4: First deployment
  Cost to visitor:  10-15 minutes
  Value delivered:  Working deployment, experienced the product
  Next trigger:     "Upgrade to unlock [feature]" in-app

Commitment 5: Upgrade to Pro
  Cost to visitor:  $29/month
  Value delivered:  Full platform, all features, no limits
  Next trigger:     N/A (converted)
```

### Implementation Rules

1. Never ask for more commitment than the value you have demonstrated
2. Each CTA must feel like the natural next step (not a jump)
3. Always reduce friction at each step:
   - Social sign-in for account creation
   - No credit card for free tier
   - One-click deploy from templates
4. Track conversion rates between each step to find drop-off points
5. Optimize the step with the highest drop-off rate first

## Objection Handling in FAQ

### FAQ Structure

The FAQ section serves as the final objection-handling mechanism before the last CTA. Questions must be ordered by objection frequency (most common first).

### Top Objections and Response Strategies

**Objection 1: "Is it reliable enough for production?"**
```
Strategy: Social proof + metrics
Answer structure:
  1. Acknowledge the concern (legitimate for any platform)
  2. State uptime SLA with specific number
  3. Reference infrastructure partners
  4. Link to live status page
  5. Mention enterprise SLA option
```

**Objection 2: "How hard is it to migrate?"**
```
Strategy: Process simplification + support offer
Answer structure:
  1. Name the specific migration path (from Docker Compose, from Vercel, etc.)
  2. State time estimate ("most teams migrate in under an hour")
  3. List the 3-step process
  4. Offer migration assistance
  5. Mention Docker Compose compatibility (zero code changes)
```

**Objection 3: "Will my costs be predictable?"**
```
Strategy: Direct contrast with competitors
Answer structure:
  1. State flat pricing clearly ($29/mo, everything included)
  2. List what is NOT charged: bandwidth, seats, SSL, support
  3. Contrast with competitor pricing model
  4. Reference savings calculator for personalized estimate
  5. Mention no annual commitment required
```

**Objection 4: "Is my data safe?"**
```
Strategy: Specifics + compliance
Answer structure:
  1. Encryption details (at rest: AES-256, in transit: TLS 1.3)
  2. Data center locations and certifications
  3. Compliance status (SOC2, GDPR)
  4. Data sovereignty options
  5. Link to security whitepaper
```

**Objection 5: "What kind of support do I get?"**
```
Strategy: Set expectations clearly
Answer structure:
  1. Response time SLAs by tier
  2. Available channels (email, chat, community)
  3. Documentation and guides available
  4. Enterprise dedicated support option
  5. Community size and activity
```

**Objection 6: "What if I outgrow the Pro plan?"**
```
Strategy: Future-proof reassurance
Answer structure:
  1. Enterprise tier for larger needs
  2. No vendor lock-in (Docker Compose = portable)
  3. Export/migration tools available
  4. Gradual scaling path
  5. Custom pricing for high-volume usage
```

## Urgency and Scarcity Patterns

### Acceptable Urgency Tactics

| Tactic | Example | Acceptable? |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Real deadline | "Early access pricing ends March 31" | Yes, if real |
| Social proof velocity | "47 teams signed up this week" | Yes, if true |
| Feature availability | "AI builder included free during beta" | Yes, if real |
| Comparison urgency | "Vercel prices increased 15% last quarter" | Yes, if verifiable |

### Unacceptable Tactics (NEVER use)

| Tactic | Example | Why Forbidden |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Fake countdown | "Offer expires in 23:59:59" (resets on refresh) | Deceptive |
| Fake scarcity | "Only 3 spots left" (unlimited product) | Dishonest |
| Dark patterns | Pre-checked upsells | Unethical |
| Fear-based | "Your site WILL go down" | Manipulative |
| Fabricated urgency | "Price increases tomorrow" (no actual increase) | Dishonest |

### Rules

1. All urgency claims must be truthful and verifiable
2. Deadlines must be real and enforced
3. Numbers must come from actual data
4. Never manufacture artificial scarcity for a digital product
5. Build urgency through value demonstration, not pressure

## Mobile Conversion Best Practices

### Mobile-Specific Patterns

**Thumb-Zone Optimization**:
```
Top of screen:     Hard to reach (informational content only)
Middle of screen:  Natural reach (secondary actions)
Bottom of screen:  Easy reach (primary CTA, navigation)
```

**Touch Target Sizing**:
```
Minimum:   44x44px (WCAG 2.1 AA)
Preferred: 48x48px (Google recommendation)
Spacing:   8px minimum between targets
```

**Content Adaptation**:
```
Desktop                          Mobile
-----------                      -----------
Full comparison table      ->    Swipeable card comparison
6-feature grid (2x3)      ->    Scrollable feature list
3 testimonials side-by-side ->  Single testimonial + swipe
Calculator with sliders    ->    Simplified calculator
```

**Sticky Bottom CTA**:
```
Triggers:    After scrolling past hero section (600px)
Height:      56-64px (enough for button + risk reversal text)
Content:     CTA button + "No credit card required"
Z-index:     40 (below modals at 50)
Animation:   Slide up from bottom
Dismiss:     User can close (tracks landing.sticky_cta.dismiss)
Visibility:  Mobile only (sm:hidden)
```

**Exit Intent on Mobile**:
```
Mobile has no cursor to track, so use:
  - Back button press detection
  - Tab switch detection (Page Visibility API)
  - Scroll-up velocity (fast upward scroll = leaving)
  - Time threshold (30+ seconds on page, about to leave)
```

### Mobile Performance Rules

1. Defer all images below the fold with `loading="lazy"`
2. Use `srcset` with mobile-optimized image sizes
3. Inline critical CSS for above-fold content
4. Defer non-critical JavaScript
5. Use skeleton screens for dynamic content (calculator, pricing)
6. Target < 3s Time to Interactive on 4G connection
7. Hero image < 100KB for mobile viewport
