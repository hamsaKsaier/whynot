- Local storage only (SQLite)
- No external dependencies beyond build tools

### Platform Constraints
- Chrome 86+ (File System Access API support)
- Firefox 82+ (partial support)
- Safari 15+ (partial support)
- Edge 86+ (File System Access API support)

### User Constraints
- No account/signup required
- No sync across devices
- No collaboration features

### Error Handling
- Photo file not found: Display error, allow removal
- Album creation fails: Display error message, retry option
- Drag and drop cancelled: Return to original position
- Storage quota exceeded: Display warning, suggest deleting albums

### Boundary Conditions
- Maximum albums: 10,000 (with pagination)
- Maximum photos per album: 50,000
- Maximum photo file size: 100 MB
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC

## Integration Points

### File System Access API
- Directory picker for photo selection
- File handles for local access
- Permissions management

### Browser Storage
- IndexedDB for album metadata
- File System API for photo storage
- LocalStorage for user settings

### Browser APIs
- Drag and Drop API for album reordering
- Clipboard API for copy/paste
- File API for photo access

## Assumptions

1. Users have modern browsers supporting File System Access API
2. Users store photos locally on device
3. Users prefer simple, fast interface over advanced features
4. Privacy is more important than convenience features
5. Users don't need photo editing capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Cloud sync or backup
- Photo editing (crop, rotate, filters)
- Face recognition or tagging
- EXIF data editing
- Photo sharing or export
- Photo duplicates detection
- Photo metadata search
- Calendar view or timeline
- Slideshow mode
- Multiple album selection
- Batch operations on albums

## Risks

### Technical Risks
- File System Access API not supported in all browsers (fallback needed?)
- Large photo collections may impact performance
- SQLite database size grows unbounded

### User Experience Risks
- Users may not understand "local only" limitation
- Data loss if browser cache cleared
- No way to recover deleted albums

### Mitigation Strategies
- Show browser compatibility warning for unsupported browsers
- Implement pagination for large collections
- Provide backup/restore functionality (future enhancement)
- Clear messaging about data storage location
