# Example: whynot MySQL Database Service Specification

## Problem Statement

whynot users need to manage MySQL databases for their applications, but currently only PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB services are available in the dashboard. Users have to manually configure MySQL through Docker Compose, which is error-prone and lacks monitoring and management features.

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Must follow whynot service component patterns
- Must use Docker containers for MySQL
- Must work with existing authentication system
- Must support RTL for Arabic interface

### Platform Constraints
- MySQL versions: 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
- Minimum database size: 100 MB
- Maximum database size: 1 TB (per instance)
- Maximum concurrent connections: 1000 (configurable)

### Integration Constraints
- Must integrate with whynot main app API

### Error Handling
- MySQL container fails to start: Display error message with logs, suggest configuration review
- Connection lost: Display reconnection indicator, auto-retry
- Backup creation fails: Display error, suggest retry with reduced load

- Credentials lost: Offer regeneration option

### Boundary Conditions
- Maximum databases per user: 100
- Maximum concurrent backups: 5
- Log retention: 7 days
- Backup retention: 30 days

## Integration Points

### Express API
- `mysql.create` - Create MySQL database
- `mysql.delete` - Delete MySQL database
- `mysql.start` - Start MySQL container
- `mysql.stop` - Stop MySQL container
- `mysql.restart` - Restart MySQL container
- `mysql.one` - Get MySQL database details
- `mysql.all` - List all MySQL databases
- `mysql.logs` - Stream MySQL logs
- `mysql.metrics` - Get performance metrics
- `mysql.backup.create` - Create backup
- `mysql.backup.restore` - Restore from backup
- `mysql.backup.delete` - Delete backup

### whynot Main App
- whynot API router for MySQL operations
- Docker container management
- Service discovery and orchestration
- Monitoring and metrics collection

### Existing Components
- Reuse log viewer from existing services
- Reuse monitoring chart components
- Reuse environment variables editor
- Reuse backup/restore UI patterns

## Design Differentiation

**Do NOT copy whynot main app patterns:**

| Main App Pattern | Client Dashboard Pattern |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Floating icon sidebar (left) | Top navigation bar or tab-based |
| Card grid (3-5 columns) | Table view or compact cards |
| 3-dot dropdown menus | Inline action buttons (always visible) |
| Multi-level nested cards | Single-level cards only |
| bg-sidebar outer + bg-background inner | Single background color |

## RTL Support Requirements

- Use logical properties: `ms-*`, `me-*`, `ps-*`, `pe-*`, `start-*`, `end-*`
- Mirror directional icons with `rtl:scale-x-[-1]`
- Use `flex-row rtl:flex-row-reverse` for directional content
- Test with Arabic locale (ar-SA)
- Ensure charts flip direction correctly

## Assumptions

1. Users have Docker container management experience
2. MySQL is the preferred database for many whynot users
3. Users need monitoring and management beyond basic Docker Compose
4. Users want self-hosted MySQL (no cloud dependencies)
5. Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure is preferred

## Out of Scope

- MySQL clustering or replication
- Read replica configuration
- High availability setup
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
- Query execution from UI
- Database schema management
- Database migration tools
- MySQL proxy or load balancer
- Custom MySQL builds or extensions
- Database performance tuning recommendations (AI-powered)
- Multi-database transactions

## Risks

### Technical Risks
- Docker container resource contention
- MySQL version compatibility issues
- Large database backup/restore timeouts
- Monitoring metrics collection overhead

### Security Risks
- Credential exposure in logs
- SQL injection via configuration editor
- Backup file access control

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement resource limits and quotas
- Test with all supported MySQL versions
- Implement backup streaming and progress indicators
- Log masking for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- Backup file encryption
