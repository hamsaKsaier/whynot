## Key Naming Conventions

1. **Use camelCase** for all keys
2. **Group related keys** in nested objects
3. **Use interpolation** for dynamic values: `{{variable}}`
4. **Keep keys descriptive** but concise
5. **Use consistent verbs**: `createFailed`, `updateFailed`, `deleteFailed`

### Examples

```
Good Keys:
- resource.notFound
- auth.invalidCredentials
- validation.string.minLength
- services.postgres.name

Bad Keys:
- error1
- not_found_resource
- STRING_MIN_LENGTH
- postgresServiceName
```

## Interpolation Patterns

### Simple Values

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello {{name}}!"
}
```

```typescript
t('emails:greeting', { name: 'John' })
// Output: "Hello John!"
```

### Multiple Values

```json
{
  "range": "Must be between {{min}} and {{max}}"
}
```

```typescript
t('validation:range', { min: 1, max: 100 })
// Output: "Must be between 1 and 100"
```

### Nested Keys

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "notFoundById": "{{resource}} with ID {{id}} not found"
  }
}
```

```typescript
t('errors:resource.notFoundById', { resource: 'Project', id: 'abc123' })
// Output: "Project with ID abc123 not found"
```

## Adding New Translations

### Step 1: Add to English First

Always add new keys to the English file first as it's the reference language.

### Step 2: Copy to Other Languages

Copy the new keys to all other language files and translate them.

### Step 3: Verify Interpolation

Ensure all interpolation variables are present in all languages.

### Step 4: Run Completeness Test

```bash
docker exec -it serverless-main-app pnpm test packages/server/src/i18n/__tests__/translation-completeness.test.ts
```

## Type Generation

Run the type generator after adding new keys:

```bash
docker exec -it serverless-main-app npx ts-node packages/server/src/i18n/scripts/generate-types.ts
```

This creates `types.generated.ts` with type definitions for all translation keys.
